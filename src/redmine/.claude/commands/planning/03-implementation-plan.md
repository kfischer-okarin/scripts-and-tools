# Create Task List

After I approve the Design, create an actionable implementation plan with a
checklist of coding tasks based on the requirements and design.
The tasks document should be based on the design document, so ensure it exists
first.

The design document is found in `docs/specs/$ARGUMENTS/design.md`.

Think very hard about the implementation plan.

**Constraints:**

- You MUST create a `docs/specs/$ARGUMENTS/tasks.md` file if it doesn't already
  exist
- You MUST return to the design step if I indicate any changes are needed to
  the design
- You MUST return to the requirement step if I indicate that we need additional
  requirements
- You MUST create an implementation plan at `docs/specs/$ARGUMENTS/tasks.md`
- You MUST use the following specific instructions when creating the
  implementation plan:

  ```md
  Convert the feature design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM
  that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize best
  practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in
  complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous
  prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or
  orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Focus ONLY on
  tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.
  ```

- You MUST format the implementation plan as a numbered checkbox list with a
  maximum of two levels of hierarchy:
  - Top-level items (like epics) should be used only when needed
  - Sub-tasks should be numbered with decimal notation (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
  - Each item must be a checkbox
  - Simple structure is preferred
- You MUST ensure each task item includes:
  - A clear objective as the task description that involves writing, modifying,
    or testing code
  - Additional information as sub-bullets under the task
  - Specific references to requirements from the requirements document
    (referencing granular sub-requirements, not just user stories)
- You MUST ensure that the implementation plan is a series of discrete,
  manageable coding steps
- You MUST ensure each task references specific requirements from the
  requirement document
- You MUST assume that all context documents (feature requirements, design)
  will be available during implementation
- You MUST ensure each step builds incrementally on previous steps
- You SHOULD prioritize test-driven development where appropriate
- You MUST ensure the plan covers all aspects of the design that can be
  implemented through code
- You SHOULD sequence steps to validate core functionality early through code
- You MUST ensure that all requirements are covered by the implementation tasks
- You MUST offer to return to previous steps (requirements or design) if gaps
  are identified during implementation planning
- You MUST ONLY include tasks that can be performed by a coding agent (writing
  code, creating tests, etc.)
- You MUST NOT include tasks related to user testing, deployment, performance
  metrics gathering, or other non-coding activities
- You MUST focus on code implementation tasks that can be executed within the
  development environment
- You MUST ensure each task is actionable by a coding agent by following these
  guidelines:
  - Tasks should involve writing, modifying, or testing specific code
    components
  - Tasks should specify what files or components need to be created or
    modified
  - Tasks should be concrete enough that a coding agent can execute them
    without additional clarification
  - Tasks should focus on implementation details rather than high-level
    concepts
  - Tasks should be scoped to specific coding activities (e.g., "Implement X
    function" rather than "Support X feature")
- You MUST explicitly avoid including the following types of non-coding tasks
  in the implementation plan:
  - User acceptance testing or user feedback gathering
  - Deployment to production or staging environments
  - Performance metrics gathering or analysis
  - Running the application to test end to end flows. We can however write
    automated tests to test the end to end from a user perspective.
  - User training or documentation creation
  - Business process changes or organizational changes
  - Marketing or communication activities
  - Any task that cannot be completed through writing, modifying, or testing
    code
- After updating the tasks document, you MUST ask me "Do the tasks look good?"
- You MUST make modifications to the tasks document if I request changes or do
  not explicitly approve.
- You MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the
  tasks document.
- You MUST NOT consider the workflow complete until receiving clear approval
  (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.).
- You MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is
  received.
- You MUST stop once the task document has been approved.

**This workflow is ONLY for creating design and planning artifacts. The actual**
**implementation of the feature should be done through a separate workflow.**

- You MUST NOT attempt to implement the feature as part of this workflow
- You MUST clearly communicate to me that this workflow is complete once the
  design and planning artifacts are created
